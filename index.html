<h1>Seattle Open Device Lab</h1>
<h2>Perfect your mobile experiences</h2>

<p><a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">Open Device Labs</a> are a shared community resource for testing apps and websites on a variety of phones, tablets and other devices. Instead of only testing on the few devices we personally own, or shelling out for a slightly larger set of test devices, we can build a comprehensive set of devices to share.

<p>As far as I can tell, Seattle doesn't have an ODL yet. I'm working on fixing this. We will have a lab available to use by December 2013. Please sign up below if you'd like to be notified when all the details are in place. Your address will only be used to announce big changes to the Seattle ODL (such as when and where it initially becomes available).

<p>If you have input, please add to this <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/device-labs/Raae2zeR-yE">thread</a> I have started on the device-lab group, ping me at <a href="https://twitter.com/alanstearns">@alanstearns</a> on Twitter, or email me (my address is my last name at adobe.com).</p>
